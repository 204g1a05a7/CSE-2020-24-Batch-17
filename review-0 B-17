#Abstract
Nowadays, Storing a large amount of data in a single file on the cloud can lead to issues like slow data access, less security, and difficulties in data management. 
To provide the solution for these we are using Cryptography technique for data security. 
Hybrid cryptography involves a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of files in the cloud.
File is splited into seven fragments. Each and every part of file is encrypted with the help of AES, Triple DES, Blowfish algorithms by applying the fragmentation. 
For decrypting reverse process of encryption is applied.
